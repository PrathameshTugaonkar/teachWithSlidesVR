# Parser and loader for Waveform OBJ files

This code is capable of loading OBJ and MTL files and producing intermediate
forms that can be turned into mesh and material definitions for any rendering
library. It also includes a specific loader for Three.js, which exposes a
Promise API to load files and return Three.js objects.
